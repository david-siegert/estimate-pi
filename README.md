# Estimate Pi

A fun implementation of Buffon's needle problem to estimate the value of π.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by an Instagram video about Buffon's needle problem. I wanted to write some code for fun to estimate PI using this problem, but ended up having GitHub Copilot do all the work right after I named the class BuffonsNeedle.

## What is Buffon's Needle Problem?

Buffon's needle is a classic problem in geometric probability that can be used to estimate π. By dropping needles onto a surface with parallel lines and counting how many cross the lines, we can calculate an approximation of π.
